<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Third Year Ph.D. Candidate at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Shouling Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5HoF_9oAAAAJ). I received my B.S. degree with honors in Computer Science from Ningbo University (Yangming Class), advised by Prof. [Diqun Yan](http://www.yandiqun.com/). My research focuses on Trustworthy Generative AI in real-world applications, especially AI Security, AI Copyright Protection, and Privacy-Preserving AI. My long-term goal is to strengthen the source governance of AI technology and rectify illegal AI applications. Recently, I have been focusing more on the Security and Privacy risks of MLLMs and T2I models. **Looking for undergraduate or graduate students with common research interests to collaborate with.**
